Shape shorthand in this module:

    N: number of images in the minibatch
    L: number of feature maps per image on which RRPN is run
    A: number of cell anchors (must be the same for all feature maps)
    Hi, Wi: height and width of the i-th feature map
    5: size of the box parameterization

Naming convention:

    objectness: refers to the binary classification of an anchor as object vs. not
    object.

    deltas: refers to the 5-d (dx, dy, dw, dh, da) deltas that parameterize the rotated box2box
    transform (see :class:`box_regression.Box2BoxTransformRotated`).

    pred_objectness_logits: predicted objectness scores in [-inf, +inf]; use
        sigmoid(pred_objectness_logits) to estimate P(object).

    gt_objectness_logits: ground-truth binary classification labels for objectness

    pred_anchor_deltas: predicted rotated box2box transform deltas

    gt_anchor_deltas: ground-truth rotated box2box transform deltas

    otherwise, returns the highest `post_nms_topk` scoring proposals for each
    feature map.

    Args:
