    This class assigns to each predicted "element" (e.g., a box) a ground-truth
    element. Each predicted element will have exactly zero or one matches; each
    ground-truth element may be matched to zero or more predicted elements.

    The matching is determined by the MxN match_quality_matrix, that characterizes
    how well each (ground-truth, prediction)-pair match each other. For example,
    if the elements are boxes, this matrix may contain box intersection-over-union
    overlap values.

    The matcher returns (a) a vector of length N containing the index of the
    ground-truth element m in [0, M) that matches to prediction n in [0, N).
    (b) a vector of length N containing the labels for each prediction.
